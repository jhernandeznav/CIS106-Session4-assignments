 Read and study the various built in functions within your programming language. Create a problem and solution in both pseudocode and program code using at least one built in function. Create a program that asks the user how old they are in years, and then calculate and display their approximate age in years, months, and days.

Get years, year_age
def year 
year_age x 1 
return year
def months
month = years x 12
return month
def day
day = months x 365
return day
def display_years(year)
print(year, ‘Years’)
def display_months(month)
print(month, ‘Months’)
def display_days(day)
print(day, ‘Days’)
def main()
year =  years()
display_years(year)
month = months()
display_months(month)
day = days()
display_days(day)
main()
2.)The problem is to allow a user to enter student last name and two exam scores and determine a total score. Use a function to do this. The first exam score is worth 40% of the total score and the second exam is worth 60%. 

Your functions should receive the two exam scores by value, determine the total and return the total score. 
Display the student last name, two exam scores and the total. 
Get name, name
Get score one, score_one
Get score two, score_two
Def cal_average_one
Cal_one = score_one x (40/100)
Return cal_one
Def cal_average_two 
Cal_two = score_two x (60/100)
Return cal_two
Def total_score
Total = cal_average_one + cal_average_two
Return total
Print name
Print ‘test score 1: ‘,  score_one
Print ‘test score 2: ‘, score_two
Def display_results
Print(‘Total score: ‘, total)
Def main
Total = total_score
Display_results(total)
Main()
3.)“This problem entails allowing the user to enter the number of airlines tickets and cost per seat for a purchase. (We will assume all seats are the same price). You are to use a function that receives the number of tickets and price per seat and calculates the cost, tax (7% of cost) and total (cost + tax). Your function should “return” the cost, tax and total. Therefore, you should pass these arguments by reference. The number of tickets and price per ticket can be passed by value. 

Display number of tickets, price per ticket, cost, tax and total.  
Get the number of tickets, num_tickets
Get the price per seats, price_per_seat
Def cost_per_seats
Cost = price_per_seat x num_tickets
Return cost
Def tax_tickets
Tax = cost_per_seats x .07
Return tax
Def total_tickets
Total = cost_per_seats + tax_tickets
Return total
Print(‘Number of plane tickets: ‘, num_tickets)
Print(‘Price per seat:$ ‘, price_per_seat
Def display_result
Print(‘The cost of the plane tickets:$ ‘, cost)
Def display
Print(‘The tax of the plane tickets:$ ‘, tax)
Def display_total
Print(‘The total cost of the plane tickets:$ ‘, total)
Def main()
Main()
